# Party Bookings Confirmation

## What Is It?

This is a Python Application that utilises Flask to create a web application that can generate Party Booking Confirmations based on user information.

This is hosted on Render and utilises their servers to run the supplied Python Script.

Due to the nature of the Python Script, user information is required to be stored on a server prior to writing to the Word Document, obviously this is a GDPR issue. The solution could be to either encrypt data or self-host the script.

A localised version has been developed, however, the web application is significantly faster and more practical.
