# Party Bookings Confirmation

## What Is It?

This is a Python Application that utilises Flask to create a web application that can generate Party Booking Confirmations based on user information.

This is hosted on Render and utilises their servers to run the supplied Python Script.

This uses the BytesIO module to uses server memory to store user information whilst the document is being generated rather than writing it to the server.

A localised version has been developed, however, the web application is significantly faster and more practical.
